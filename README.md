The Holiday Manager is designed to be a user-friendly system for adding, tracking, and removing holidays over 2020 to 2024.

The main menu has five options that the user can choose from.

Option 1 allows adding a holiday by name and date.
Option 2 allows removing holidays as long as the user knows the name and date and the holiday exists.
Option 3 saves any holiday changes from the first two options to a local JSON file.
Option 4 allows the user to view a particular week within the four-year period at their discretion. Should they view the current week of the year, they will be able to opt to view the weather of the zip code 11223 (Brooklyn, NY) associated with each holiday taking place.
Option 5 exits the program, indicating whether changes have previously been saved or not to prevent unintentional loss of data.
